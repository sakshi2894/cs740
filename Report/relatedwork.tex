\cite{ref:paper2} proposes the RA-RA algorithm for resource aware routing for service function chains in SDN and NFV enabled networks. They conduct a MATLAB simulation on CORONET CONUS topology. They compare RA-RA with COATS, SP and Eigendecomposition algorithms. These algorithms use the shortest path routing to route the flows and use a greedy approach to find an optimal matching between the SFC request and network topology. It is observed that RA-RA performs the best among these algorithms. \cite{ref:paper1} compares TMA and PDA with Random, Greedy and Upper Bound algorithms. In their study TMA performs the best(close to Upper Bound) followed by PDA.

Our results show that among the online algorithms, PDA performs better than RA-RA. The performance of TMA is comparable to the ideal case where all the flows can be routed through a given network without any constraints.
