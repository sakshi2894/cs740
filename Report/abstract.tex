In this paper, we do a comparative study of three different service function chaining algorithms. First Algorithm is Max Throughput Routing Algorithm \cite{ref:paper1} which is an offline algorithm. Second is an online algorithm based on Linear Programming, Primal Dual Update Algorithm \cite{ref:paper1}. Third is the RA-RA algorithm \cite{ref:paper2} which is also an online routing algorithm based on Binary Integer Programming. We experiment on two different topologies, Fat-Tree \cite{ref:fat-tree} from \cite{ref:paper1} and CORONET CONUS \cite{ref:coronus} from \cite{ref:paper2}. The results of the experiments are presented by plotting the achievable throughput against the number of flows. We are able to show that the offline Max Throughput Routing Algorithm outperforms both online algorithms. Also, among the two online algorithms we show that Primal Dual Update Algorithm performs better than the RA-RA algorithm.
